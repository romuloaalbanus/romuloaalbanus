### **I am Web Developer Full-Stack!**

I recently got to know programming in depth and was fascinated with the world of technology.
I started my studies in Architecture and Urbanism and worked as
Computer Aided Design Designer for 4 years. Despite being an interesting area, I decided to change my career and also my country.
I've been living in Aachen â€“ Germany for 2 years and decided to deepen my studies in the most submerged way possible, which was to do Ironhack's Bootcamp Web Developer.
